# 🧠 Noggin - Brain Training App

**Wake up your brain in just 4 minutes each day!**

Noggin is a minimalist, playful web application designed to help users sharpen their cognitive abilities through a series of engaging brain-training challenges. Built with React and TypeScript, it provides a seamless, linear experience that tests speed, focus, logic, and memory.


### 🎯 **Linear Challenge Flow**

- **Home** → **Speed Challenge** → **Focus Challenge** → **Logic Challenge** → **Memory Challenge** → **Results**
- Each challenge is designed to be completed in under a minute
- Total session time: ~4 minutes

### 🧩 **Four Brain Training Challenges**

1. **Speed Challenge** (25 seconds)

   - Tap highlighted shapes as quickly as possible
   - Tests reaction time and visual processing speed
   - 3x3 grid with various shape emojis

2. **Focus Challenge** (25 seconds)

   - Find the unique shape among pairs
   - Tests attention to detail and pattern recognition
   - 3x5 grid with 15 shapes (7 pairs + 1 unique)

3. **Logic Challenge** (30 seconds)

   - Solve logic puzzles with multiple-choice answers
   - Tests reasoning ability and problem-solving skills
   - Example: "If two cats can catch two mice in two minutes, how many cats are needed to catch 100 mice in 100 minutes?"

4. **Memory Challenge** (Variable time)
   - Memorize a sequence of 12 symbols (5 seconds)
   - Recreate the sequence from shuffled positions
   - Tests working memory and recall ability
